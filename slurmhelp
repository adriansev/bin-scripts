   Summary of SLURM Commands
   =========================================
   Man pages exist for all SLURM daemons, 
   commands, and API functions. The command 
   option --help also provides a brief 
   summary of options. Note that the command 
   options are all case insensitive.
   =========================================

   sacct 
      sacct is used to report job or job 
      step accounting information about 
      active or completed jobs.

   salloc
      salloc is used to allocate resources 
      for a job in real time. Typically 
      this is used to allocate resources 
      and spawn an interactive shell. The 
      shell is then used to execute srun 
      commands to launch parallel tasks.

   sattach
      sattach is used to attach standard 
      input, output, and error plus signal 
      capabilities to a currently running 
      job or job step. One can attach to 
      and detach from jobs multiple times.

   sbatch
      sbatch is used to submit a job script 
      for later execution. The script will 
      typically contain one or more srun 
      commands to launch parallel tasks. 
      sbatch is analogous to the PBS qsub
      command.

   sbcast
      sbcast is used to transfer a file from 
      local disk to local disk on the nodes 
      allocated to a job. This can be used 
      to effectively use diskless compute 
      nodes or provide improved performance 
      relative to a shared file system.

   scancel
      scancel is used to cancel a pending or 
      running job or job step. It can also 
      be used to send an arbitrary signal to 
      all processes associated with a running
      job or job step. scancel is analogous 
      to the PBS qdel command.

   scontrol
      scontrol is the administrative tool 
      used to view and/or modify SLURM state. 
      Note that many scontrol commands can 
      only be executed by system admins.

   sinfo
      sinfo reports the state of partitions 
      and nodes managed by SLURM. It has a 
      wide variety of filtering, sorting, 
      and formatting options.

   smap
      smap reports state information for 
      jobs, partitions, and nodes managed 
      by SLURM, but graphically displays 
      the information to reflect network 
      topology.

   squeue
      squeue reports the state of jobs or 
      job steps. It has a wide variety of 
      filtering, sorting, and formatting 
      options. By default, it reports the 
      running jobs in priority order and 
      then the pending jobs in priority 
      order. squeue is analogous to the PBS
      qstat command.

   srun
      srun is used to submit a job for 
      execution or initiate job steps in 
      real time. srun has a wide variety 
      of options to specify resource 
      requirements, including: minimum and 
      maximum node count, processor count, 
      specific nodes to use or not use, and 
      specific node characteristics (so much 
      memory, disk space, certain required 
      features, etc.). A job can contain 
      multiple job steps executing 
      sequentially or in parallel on 
      independent or shared nodes within the 
      job's node allocation.

   strigger
      strigger is used to set, get or view 
      event triggers. Event triggers include 
      things such as nodes going down or 
      jobs approaching their time limit.

   sview
      sview is a graphical user interface 
      to get and update state information 
      for jobs, partitions, and nodes 
      managed by SLURM.

   Summary of STUBL SLURM Commands
   =========================================
   These are commands added by UB CCR staff
   and others as part of STUBL (SLURM Tools
   and UBiLities). 
   Many of these commands are designed to 
   help users transition from PBS to SLURM.
   =========================================
   
   fisbatch
      A customized version of sbatch that 
      provides a user-friendly interface
      to an interactive job with X11
      forwarding enabled. It is analogous
      to the PBS "qsub -I -X" command.

   pbs2sbatch
      Converts PBS directives to equivalent
      SLURM SBATCH directives. Accommodates
      old UB CCR-specific PBS tags like IB1, 
      IB2, etc.

   pbs2slurm
      A script that attempts to convert PBS
      scripts into corresponding SBATCH 
      scripts.  It will convert PBS 
      directives as well as PBS environment
      variables and will insert bash code to
      create a SLURM_NODEFILE that is 
      consistent with the PBS_NODEFILE.

  sgetscr
      Retrieves the SLURM/SBATCH script and 
      environment files for a job that is queued 
      or running.

   sjeff
      Determines the efficiency of one or more
      running jobs. Inefficient jobs are high-
      lighted in red text. (see also sueff)

   slist
      Retrieves SLURM accounting and node 
      information for a running or completed 
      job.

   slogs
      Retrieves resource usage and accounting 
      information for a user or list of users.  
      For each job that was run after the given 
      start date, the following information is 
      gathered from the SLURM accounting logs:  
         num CPUS, start time, elapsed time, 
         Amount of RAM Requested, Average RAM 
         Used and Max RAM Used

   slurmbf
      Analogous to the PBS \"showbf -S\" 
      command. 

   snacct
      Retrieves SLURM accounting information for  
      a given node and for a given period of time.
      (see also suacct)

   snodes
      A customized version of sinfo. Displays
      node information in an easy-to-interpet
      format. Filters can be applied to view
      (1) specific nodes, (2) nodes in a 
      specific partition, or (3) nodes in a
      specifc state.

   spinfo
      Show partition information for a cluster(s).
      All arguments are passed along to the sinfo 
      command. spinfo is an alias for:               
        sinfo -h -a -o \"%8P %5a %.10l %.5D %6t\"

   sqelp
      A customized version of squeue that
      only prints a double-quote if the 
      information in a column is the same from 
      row to row. Some users find this type of
      formatting easier to visually digest.

   sqstat
      A customized version of squeue that 
      produces output analogous to the PBS
      qstat and xqstat commands.

   sranks 
      A command that lists the overall 
      priorities and associated priority 
      components of queued jobs in ascending 
      order. Top-ranked jobs will be given 
      priority by the scheduler but lower 
      ranked jobs may get slotted in first 
      if they fit into the scheduler's 
      backfill window.

   stimes
      Retrieves estimated starting times for 
      queued jobs. All user-provided arguments are 
      passed along to the squeue command.

   suacct
      Retrieves SLURM accounting information for
      a given user's jobs for a given period of 
      time. (see also snacct)

   sueff
     Determines the overall efficiency of the
     running jobs of one or more users. Users
     that are inefficient are highlighted in 
     red text. (see also sjeff)

      squeue bugs in earlier versions of SLURM." \

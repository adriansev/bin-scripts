# LC_ALL This variable determines the values for all locale categories. The value of the LC_ALL environment variable has precedence over any of the other environment variables starting with LC_ (LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_MONETARY, LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME) and the LANG environment variable.
# LANG This variable determines the locale category for native language, local customs and coded character set in the absence of the LC_ALL and other LC_* (LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_MONETARY, LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME) environment variables. This can be used by applications to determine the language to use for error messages and instructions, collating sequences, date formats, and so forth.
# LC_COLLATE This variable determines the locale category for character collation. It determines collation information for regular expressions and sorting, including equivalence classes and multi-character collating elements, in various utilities and the strcoll() and strxfrm() functions. Additional semantics of this variable,if any, are implementation-dependent.
# LC_CTYPE This variable determines the locale category for character handling functions, such as tolower(), toupper() and isalpha(). This environment variable determines the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters), the classification of characters (for example, alpha, digit, graph) and the behaviour of character classes. Additional semantics of this variable, if any, are implementation-dependent.
# LC_MESSAGES This variable determines the locale category for processing affirmative and negative responses and the language and cultural conventions in which messages should be written. It also affects the behaviour of the catopen() function in determining the message catalogue. Additional semantics of this variable, if any,are implementation-dependent. The language and cultural conventions of diagnostic and informative messages whose format is unspecified by this specification set should be affected by the setting of LC_MESSAGES.
# LC_MONETARY This variable determines the locale category for monetary-related numeric formatting information. Additional semantics of this variable, if any, are implementation-dependent.
# LC_NUMERIC This variable determines the locale category for numeric formatting (for example, thousands separator and radix character) information in various utilities as well as the formatted I/O operations in printf() and scanf() and the string conversion functions in strtod(). Additional semantics of this variable, if any,are implementation-dependent.
# LC_TIME This variable determines the locale category for date and time formatting information. It affects the behaviour of the time functions in strftime(). Additional semantics of this variable, if any, are implementation-dependent.
